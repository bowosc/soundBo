<h1>soundBo</h1>
<p>
  soundBo is a small, customizable, and minimalistic soundboard for the MacOS menu bar.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
  soundBo started when my roommates would not stop laughing at various stupid sound effects, but apparently had some trouble playing them at the worst possible times. 
</p>
<p>
  According to some customer reports of competitor apps, the "Curb Your Enthusiasm" theme played after I fumble a question on a live Zoom interview apparently came several milliseconds later than they had liked.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<img width="459" alt="soundBo in the MacOS menu bar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51af2531-6327-4224-85ab-6e39e15558a6"></br>

</br>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>
  With soundBo, the experience is optimized for the smallest possible delay from the dumb idea popping into your head to the stupid sound actually playing. 
</p>
<p>
  The goal here is that only two clicks are necessary: the selection of the menu bar app and the play button on the sound. 
  By using the MacOS menu bar, we get around the delay caused by finding, clicking, and opening an application icon. </br>
</p>
<p>
    This saves my roommates precious time while attempting to turn my day-to-day into a clip from a 2015 meme compilation.

  Source code is still availible, of course, if you'd like to compile it yourself. :)
